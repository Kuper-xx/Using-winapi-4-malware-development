# Malware Development with Windows API

### Overview
I am currently learning about the development of malware using Windows API. My focus is on understanding how to execute code from various sections of a binary, such as `.text`, `.data`, and `.rsrc`.

### What I’m Learning
- **Windows API**: I am using Windows API functions to manipulate and execute code within a binary. These APIs provide the tools necessary to interact with system processes and memory.
  
- **Code Execution from Sections**:
  - **.text section**: This is the section where the actual code of the binary resides. I am exploring how to execute malicious code directly from this section.
  - **.data section**: This section typically contains initialized global variables. I am learning how to leverage it to execute custom code.
  - **.rsrc section**: This section holds resources like icons, images, or strings. I’m experimenting with hiding and executing code from this unconventional part of a binary.

### Why This Matters
Understanding how to execute code from these sections of a binary helps to bypass traditional security mechanisms, as different sections serve different purposes in program execution. It also helps in exploring more advanced techniques for evading detection and building more resilient payloads.
